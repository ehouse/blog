My collection of D&D stories and rules I've created over years of playing 3.5
and Pathfinder. I've also included a second for some homebrew campaigns I'm
working on.

### D&D Stories

* [Wrath of the Lich Witch: Part 1](/wrath-of-the-lich-witch-part-1.html)

### House Rules

* [D&D House Rules](/pages/dd-house-rules.html)  
I've written up some rules that I play with in my games.

### Homebrewed Adventures

I'm currently writing my own homebrew adventure. When it is done and I've played
through it I will be posting it here.
