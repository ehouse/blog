  <h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Party arrives in desert town on horseback hungry and dehydrated.</li>
<li>Party visits Elricos Pub and learn more about Desert Lighthouse</li>
</ul>
<h2>Campaign Breakdown</h2>
<h3>Distinct Characters</h3>
<h3>Distinct Places</h3>
<h3>Encounters</h3>
<h2>Story Notes</h2>
<h3>Part 1 : Desert Rose</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Desert Lighthouse stands on a massive dune visible for mile around. It's
 built of marble and sandstone and gleams in the early sun. The surrounding
 towns frequently spread rumors about it's mysterious origins and it's rarely
 seen inhabitants. Filled with gold and men that stand 10 feet tall are the
 more frequent of the tales. The more educated know this tower to be filled
 with follows of a dark religion. Their bodies covered in scars and
 mutilations proving their devotion. Your purpose here is not wealth but for a
 herb. A plant is thought to exist that renders it's consumer immortal. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Part 2 : Into the Depth</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The party descends the rickety ladder into the depth of the tomb entrance.
 With each step down the light fades away and each breath becomes harder.
 Finally you feel ground and you step off the ladder. The room illuminated by
 only your torch.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Part 3 : A Rose by any other name</h3>
<h2>Rooms Descriptions</h2>
<h3>Desert Lighthouse</h3>
<h5>1. Entrance</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>You enter a large circler room with only a stairwell at the far wall.
 The only sand, dirt, or speck of dust in the entire room was brought in by
 you a moment ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This room like every other room in the lighthouse is kept obsessivly clean by
it's owners. Other then the spiral staircase there is nothing of note in this
room.</p>
<h3>Tomb</h3>
<h5>1. Entrance Room</h5>
<h5>10. Statue Room</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>You walk into a room filled with chest high pillars. About half of them have
 statues of demons in varies aggressive positions as if beckoning you to
 attack. The light is flickering off and on every few seconds plunging the
 room into oppressive darkness. You hear faint laughing every time the room is
 darkened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The room is unnaturally dark. Every other turn no character will be able to see
unless they have magical dark vision. Only in this darkness are the statues able
to move. Magical light will dispel the darkness.</p>
<h5>11. Reward room</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>This tiny room reeks of death. There are 3 chests sitting center of the room.
 In the corner lies a half consumed corpse clutching a bloody book. A bloody
 hand print is visible on the other door.</p>
