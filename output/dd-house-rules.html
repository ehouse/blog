<h2><a href="./dd-house-rules.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to D&D House Rules">D&D House Rules</a></h2>
<div class="article-list">
<p>These are the rules and guidelines I've built up over years of playing D&amp;D 3.5
and Pathfinder. They've always worked well in the games I've DM'ed but feel free
to cherry pick rules to your own groups play style.</p>
<h2>Small Rule Changes</h2>
<h4>Critical Rolls</h4>
<p>Critical rolls (1 or 20) during combat act as a -10 or +10 for the roll
respectively. A critical roll can not make the impossible happen. So if you roll
a Natural 20 the die roll becomes a 30. If you roll a Natural 1 the die roll
becomes a -10.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>eg.</strong> 1000 peasants dealing on average 25 criticals a round can not kill an
adult dragon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Critical rolls out of combat count as a -5 or a +5 to the roll. So a Natural 20
would be a die roll of 25 and a Natural 1 would be a die roll of -5.</p>
<h4>Heal Check</h4>
<p>I've always wished there was more to the heal check. Spell casters are really
the only ones who can really heal you and if you're dead you better start
praying for a cleric. </p>
<p><strong>Resuscitation</strong> : Within 5 minutes of a characters death assuming the
character does does not have injuries incompatible with life (<strong>eg.</strong>
decapitation) a living player may attempt to resuscitate a dead player. If the
value rolled on a d100 falls within the range of 1 and your Heal Skill + 10 then
you are successful in resuscitating the fallen character. It takes 5 rounds to
complete a full cycle of resuscitation and leaves the character performing it
fatigued.</p>
<p>After each attempt at resuscitation the character performing it takes a -10 to
the check. A character may continue to resuscitate as long as their check stays
above zero. A fallen character can have no more then 5 attempts at
resuscitation. If resuscitation is successful then the fallen character is
revived at their lowest possible health stable with zero negative levels.</p>
<h2>Outright Banned</h2>
<h4>Level Adjustments</h4>
<p>If it has one, you can't play it. Zero discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>eg.</strong> My Dragonkin Ghost Lich is totally fair! Yeah I have 2 5d6 natural
attacks and I can fly at level 1 but it's level adjusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Sacred Geometry</h4>
<p>Holy crap no.</p>
<h4>Gunslinger</h4>
<p>It's not that I find them too powerful but that I find them breaking the flow of
combat. They're so nerfed to keep their weird rules fair that it's actually not
fun to play. They're also super out of place in a high fantasy world of D&amp;D.</p>
<p>My one caveat to the rule is that I do allow gunpowder weapons in the form of
cannons.</p>
<h2>Rules of Insanity</h2>
<p>A small set of rules that work with insanity and loss of mental status. The
system works on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is normal and 10 is blithering idiot.</p>
<p>Every character starts at zero unless they wish otherwise for back story
reasons.  Any character that witnesses a horrific action has a chance to moving
up the scale. There is a DC to save based on the significance of the horror that
was witnessed based on the table below. When a character moves up the scale the
character is <em>shaken for 1d4 hours</em>. A Critical Fail leaves character <em>panicked for
1d4 minutes</em> or until away from the source of the save. Major DM discretion is
required when determining which save to use.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Horror</th>
<th>DC Will Save</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Minor</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>Near life/death situation or jump scare</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Medium</td>
<td>20</td>
<td>Family or friend died tragically</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Major</td>
<td>25</td>
<td>Witness a massacre</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Insanity can be reversed in a few ways. Normal rules for Types of Insanity still
apply and a character may attempt to reverse the effects once a week by beating
the Will Save. When a successful save occurs a point of insanity is also
removed. Any character my attempt to remove a single point of insanity from a
character. This save may only be attempted once per character per day. It
requires one hour of uninterupted quiet and has a DC of <em>10 + Characters insanity
score</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Insanity of 0</strong> : Perfectly normal. There are no adverse effects for being here.</p>
<p><strong>Between 1-3</strong> : Characters that are odd or have occasional outbursts.
From this point forward add your insanity score to resist mind altering effects.
Your insanity score is the penalty to add to Perception Check and Sense Motive.</p>
<p><strong>Between 4-6</strong> : Characters that are generally unstable and have
frequent outbursts.  Each step forward in this and following categories requires
the character to roll for a <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/gameMasteryGuide/sanityAndMadness.html">Type of Insanity</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Between 7-9</strong> : Characters that have brief moments of lucid action.</p>
<p><strong>Insanity of 10</strong> : Characters are never in control of their own actions. If
not cured character is considered out of play in a similar vein as death. They
are as much a danger to them selves as they are to the rest of the party.</p>
<h2>Points of Interest</h2>
<h4>Back Story</h4>
<p>Anything non-standard for a character in an environment in D&amp;D MUST be explained
by a back story. Anything from a paragraph to a full page will make the DM
happy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>eg.</strong> A 6 legged mantis man from the desert won't have points in swim.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Non-standard Races</h4>
<p>You must inform the DM at least once of your non-standard race. If you have four
legs and you don't tell the DM, he will remove two of them.</p>
<h4>Sexy Characters</h4>
<p>It's a privilege, not a right.</p>
<h4>Spells</h4>
<p>Prepared spell casters must write down all of their spells known that day.
Changes may be made to the list during the session rules permitting. No more
pretending you had that super important spell prepared the whole time.</p>
<h4>Aquatic Characters</h4>
<p>Transportation must be worked out before hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>eg.</strong> I'm playing a mermaid princess. I've got my loyal followers to carry
me around in a fish bowl.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Puns are Punishable by Blood</h4>
<p>When the DM wills it, there will be blood.</p>
<h2>Guidelines and Suggestions</h2>
<h4>Good Vs. Evil</h4>
<p>Morality is a hard topic to cover in D&amp;D. I view it as the fight for good and
evil by the gods. Would good aligned gods agree with your actions? Would a evil
god congratulate you for your pillaging?</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong> : Someone who is morally good in the eyes of the gods. Willing to go
the extra mile to help those around him without expecting compensation.</p>
<p>This does not mean your character has to personally stop all evil he witnesses.
Nor do you need to donate all personal wealth to the poor. Your character needs
to weigh the cost of the decisions he makes. Attacking a guard who is beating up
a homeless man is not worth the jail time nor the beatings you'll receive.
Working your way up through the legal system to get the guard fired may be
though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wizard who volunteers feeding and healing the sick and disposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neutral</strong> : Someone who is neither good nor evil in the eyes of the gods.
Often times they are a loner or detached from the hard decisions life has to
offer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A woodsman caring for his family. He cares little for the war waging outside
of his forest home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Evil</strong> : Someone who is morally evil in the eyes of the gods. This does not
mean you are Satan incarnate and have to kill every kitten or orphan you see.
This often manifests itself as power or authority complexes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A guard who collects bribes in exchange for "protection" from the local gangs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Lawful Vs. Chaos</h4>
<p>I can't sum it up better then what the books say. Source can be found
<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules#TOC-Law-Versus-Chaos">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect authority, honor
tradition, and judge those who fall short of their duties. Chaotic characters
follow their consciences, resent being told what to do, favor new ideas over
tradition, and do what they promise if they feel like it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Lawful</strong> : Law implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and
reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include closed-mindedness,
reactionary adherence to tradition, self-righteousness, and a lack of
adaptability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A trader more interested in money then the going ons in the land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Neutral</strong> : Someone detached from society would be considered Neutral. While
they aren't driven to rebel they have no compulsion to help others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A ranger uninterested in city life lives in the woods living off of wild
plants and whatever he can hunt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chaotic</strong> : Chaos implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the
downside, chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate
authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A warrior fighting to overthrow his oppressive government.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Party Dynamics</h3>
<p>D&amp;D is essentially a teamwork game. You rely on your friends characters
to keep you alive in battle. For this to work everyone's characters need
to be able to trust each other. No one is going to trust a Rogue who
keeps jerking around the party or a Wizard that just blew up a village.
Actually get into your character and think. If the shifty Rogue you
hired gets caught hoarding loot or robbing players the party is going to
tie them up and leave them by the side of the road. No questions asked.</p>
<p>This is precisely why evil characters don't work. Their morality doesn't
align with society and they have issues playing with others. Sure, your
character wants to end the world and kill babies but you'll have a hell
of a time finding others who share these views.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Don't be a jerk.</p>
<h3>You're playing a game</h3>
<p>Never forget that. It's about having fun solving puzzles and blowing up
monsters. It's about feeling awesome when you save the princess from the dragon.
If your not having fun something is fundamentally wrong.</p>
<h3>Be Unique</h3>
<p>Stories of past campaigns get repeated quite a lot around new players so it's no
surprise they are itching to capitalize on those stories. I strongly suggest
resisting the urge and instead forging your own stories.</p>
<h3>Other Thoughts</h3>
<ol>
<li>Don't plot against the DM. You will lose.</li>
<li>Better to specialize then generalize.</li>
<li>If you don't speak common, I hate you.</li>
<li>Write the back story first then build your stats. Flawed characters tend to
   be the most fun to play.</li>
<li>Make your character to have fun, not fill a niche in the party.</li>
</ol>
