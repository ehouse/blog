  <p class="date">Posted on October 30, 2013 by Ethan House</p>
  <p>I have become increasingly frustrated with octopress and its complexities. The
tools I was using to maintain the blog were unnecessarily complicated for what
they were doing. I was constantly looking for fixes for problems I didn't
understand. Official documentation I found was just plain wrong at times. So I
decided it was time for something that made a little more sense for me.</p>
<p>I switched to Pelican which is a python based static blog generator. There are a
couple of oddities I have noticed which I am still trying to work out. Weird CSS
rules that apply to page elements that don't make sense. It is also much easier
to setup. Now if only I could figure out how images and plugins worked but that
will have to wait till the morning.</p>
