  <h2><a href="./openbsd-x11-setup.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to OpenBSD X11 Setup">OpenBSD X11 Setup</a></h2>
  <p class="date">Posted on September 17, 2013 by Ethan House</p>
  <p>This is my personal setup for my openbsd laptop. I use i3 as my window manager
and i3lock as a screen lock daemon.</p>
<h3>xinitrc</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>xmodmap -e <span class="s1">&#39;remove Lock = Caps\_Lock&#39;</span>
xmodmap -e <span class="s1">&#39;keysym Caps\_Lock = Control\_L&#39;</span>
xmodmap -e <span class="s1">&#39;add Control = Control\_L&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I personally believe the home row is far to important for a caps lock
key. So I remap it to left control. Makes bash and vim commands easier
to type. I found the easiest program to use was xmodmap. Just keep in
mind that in single user mode these settings will not take effect as X11
is never started.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">LANG</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;en\_US.UTF-8&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> MM<span class="se">\_</span>CHARSET<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;UTF-8&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I had issues with i3 overwriting locale settings. The solution was to
set them in xinit instead of zshrc.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">LOCK=&quot;i3lock -i /home/ehouse/Pictures/Wallpapers/lockscreen.png&quot;</span>
<span class="x">xautolock -locker &quot;\</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">LOCK</span><span class="x">&quot; -nowlock &quot;\</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">LOCK</span><span class="x">&quot; &amp;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I was playing around with slimlock originally but it is incompatible
with FreeBSD. It requires specific libraries only available in the Linux
kernel. Instead I decided to use i3lock and xautolock. Simple, but works
well.</p>
<h3>i3/config</h3>
<p>I am only going to include code that wasn't auto generated.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># start a terminal</span>
bindsym <span class="se">\$</span>mod+Return <span class="nb">exec</span> sakura

<span class="c1"># Screen Lock</span>
bindsym <span class="se">\$</span>mod+q <span class="nb">exec</span> <span class="s2">&quot;xautolock -locknow&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Instead of relying on i3-sensible-terminal I just wrote in sakura. It is
gtk based terminal that doesn't have an incredible dependency list like
terminator or roxterm. I set a shortcut for locking the display.
Xautolock and i3lock both support suspend and lock but I haven't played
around with it yet. I chose meta+q as it was not something I would
accidentally hit.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">exec</span> --no-startup-id nitrogen â€“restore
</pre></div>


<p>nitrogen works very well for setting X wallpapers. It requires that you
start nitrogen and manually set the wallpaper though. It doesn't support
sideshow wallpapers but it probably wouldn't be too hard to write a
cronjob to do that.</p>
<p>I also remapped all of the movement keys over one to be more vimlike. I
use G and V for horizontal and vertical splits. As much as I understand
why they didn't go with hjkl I don't want to relearn the land positions.
And finally I used i3menu for the menu bar. It comes with i3 and it is
very easy to configure. It doesn't put much load on the system when
polling which is always a plus. Laptop battery life is precious.</p>
<p>That is my X11 setup in a nutshell. If anyone is interested in how I got
something to work don't hesitate and throw me an email. I always enjoy a
good technical conversation.</p>
