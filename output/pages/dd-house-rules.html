<h2><a href="../pages/dd-house-rules.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to D&D House Rules">D&D House Rules</a></h2>
<div class="article-list">
<p>These are the rules and guidlines I've built up over years of playing D&amp;D 3.5
and Pathfinder. They've always worked well in the games I've DM'ed but feel free
to cherry pick rules to your own groups play style.</p>
<h2>Small Rule Changes</h2>
<h4>Critical Rolls</h4>
<p>Critical rolls (1 or 20) during combat act as a -10 or +10 for the roll
respectively. A critical roll can not make the impossible happen. So if you roll
a Natural 20 the die roll becomes a 30. If you roll a Natural 1 the die roll
becomes a -10.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>eg.</strong> 1000 peasants dealing on average 25 criticals a round can not kill an adult dragon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Critical rolls out of combat count as a -5 or a +5 to the roll. So a Natural 20
would be a die roll of 25 and a Natural 1 would be a die roll of -5.</p>
<h2>Outright Banned</h2>
<h4>Level Adjustments</h4>
<p>If it has one, you can't play it. Zero discussion. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>eg.</strong> My Dragonkin Ghost Lich is totally fair! Yeah I have 2 5d6 natural attacks and I can fly at level 1 but it's level adjusted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Sacred Geometry</h4>
<p>Holy crap is this ability unfair.</p>
<h4>Gunslinger</h4>
<p>It's not that I find them too powerful but that I find them breaking the flow of
combat. They're so nerfed to keep their weird rules fair that it's actually not
fun to play. They're also super out of place in a high fantasy world of
D&amp;D.</p>
<p>My one caveat to the rule is that I do allow gunpower weapons in the form of
cannons.</p>
<h2>Points of Interest</h2>
<h4>Back Story</h4>
<p>Anything non-standard for a character in an environment in D&amp;D MUST be explained
by a back story. Anything from a paragraph to a full page will make the DM
happy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>eg.</strong> A 6 legged mantis man from the desert won't have points in swim.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Non-standard Races</h4>
<p>You must inform the DM at least once of your non-standard race. If you have four
legs and you don't tell the DM, he will remove two of them.</p>
<h4>Sexy Characters</h4>
<p>It's a privilege, not a right.</p>
<h4>Spells</h4>
<p>Prepared spell casters must write down all of their spells known that day.
Changes may be made to the list during the session rules permitting. No more
pretending you had that super important spell prepared the whole time.</p>
<h4>Aquatic Characters</h4>
<p>Transportation must be worked out before hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>eg.</strong> I'm playing a mermaid princess. I've got my loyal followers to carry me around in a fish bowl.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Puns are Punishable by Blood</h4>
<p>When the DM wills it, there will be blood.</p>
<h2>Guidelines and Suggestions</h2>
<h4>Good Vs. Evil</h4>
<p>Morality is a hard topic to cover in D&amp;D. I view it as the fight for good and
evil by the gods. Would good aligned gods agree with your actions? Would a evil
god congratulate you for your pillaging?</p>
<h5>Good</h5>
<p>Someone who is morally good in the eyes of the gods. Willing to go the extra
mile to help those around him without expecting compensation.</p>
<p>This does not mean your character has to personally stop all evil he witnesses.
Nor do you need to donate all personal wealth to the poor. Your character needs
to weigh the cost of the decisions he makes. Attacking a guard who is beating up
a homeless man is not worth the jail time nor the beatings you'll receive.
Working your way up through the legal system to get the guard fired may be
though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A wizard who volunteers feeding and healing the sick and disposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Neutral</h5>
<p>Someone who is neither good nor evil in the eyes of the gods. Often times they
are a loner or detached from the hard decisions life has to offer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A woodsman caring for his family. He cares little for the war waging outside of his forest home.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Evil</h5>
<p>Someone who is morally evil in the eyes of the gods. This does not mean you are
Satan incarnate and have to kill every kitten or orphan you see. This often
manifests itself as power or authority complexes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A guard who collects bribes in exchange for "protection" from the local gangs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Lawful Vs. Chaos</h4>
<p>I can't sum it up better then what the books say. Source can be found
<a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules#TOC-Law-Versus-Chaos">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall short of their duties. Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do what they promise if they feel like it. </p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Lawful</h5>
<p>Law implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and reliability. On
the downside, lawfulness can include closed-mindedness, reactionary adherence to
tradition, self-righteousness, and a lack of adaptability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A trader more interested in money then the going ons in the land.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Neutral</h5>
<p>Someone detached from society would be considered Neutral. While they aren't
driven to rebel they have no compulsion to help others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A ranger uninterested in city life lives in the woods living off of wild plants and whatever he can hunt.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Chaotic</h5>
<p>Chaos implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the downside, chaos can
include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate authority, arbitrary actions,
and irresponsibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A warrior fighting to overthrow his oppressive government.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Party Dynamics</h3>
<p>D&amp;D is essentially a teamwork game. You rely on your friends characters to keep
you alive in battle. For this to work everyone's characters need to be able to
trust each other. No one is going to trust a Rogue who keeps jerking around the
party or a Wizard that just blew up a village. Actually get into your character
and think. If the shifty Rogue you hired gets caught hoarding loot or robbing
players the party is going to tie them up and leave them by the side of the
road. No questions asked.</p>
<p>This is precisely why evil characters don't work. Their morality doesn't align
with society and they have issues playing with others. Sure, your character
wants to end the world and kill babies but you'll have a hell of a time finding
others who share these views.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Don't be a jerk.</p>
<h3>You're playing a game</h3>
<p>Never forget that. It's about having fun solving puzzles and blowing up
monsters. It's about feeling awesome when you save the pricess from the dragon.
If your not having fun something is fundemently wrong.</p>
<h3>Other Thoughts</h3>
<ol>
<li>Take points in swimming. Join a swim club. Take swim lessons.</li>
<li>Don't plot against the DM. You will lose.</li>
<li>Better to specialize then generalize.</li>
<li>If you don't speak common, I hate you.</li>
<li>Write the back story first then build your stats. Flawed characters tend to be the most fun to play.</li>
<li>Make your character to have fun, not fill a niche in the party.</li>
</ol>
